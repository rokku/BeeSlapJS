# BeeSlapJS

Bee Slap, a coding challenge I give to developers, done in pure JavaScript (for a PHP version, see here: https://github.com/rokku/SlapGame

The attempt here, as with the SlapGame repo, is to provide the game in as little code as possible, while following modular patterns.

As of Sept 16, 2016, this is a first complete pass at the game; some definite tidying up needed!

1. Download repo
2. `npm install` for dependencies
3. `gulp` for script process/concat/etc and launch of a local server.
